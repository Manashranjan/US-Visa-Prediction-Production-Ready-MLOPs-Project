# ðŸ›‚ Visa Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a **visa application** will be approved or denied based on applicant and employer-related features. The goal is to build a reliable ML pipeline that can assist in identifying key factors influencing visa approvals.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data ingestion and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in visa approvals
- Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV/Optuna
- Model evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
- End-to-End pipeline for training and prediction
- Deployment-ready with Flask/FastAPI
